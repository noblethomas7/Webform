# Webform
In this repository, you can find the codes and supporting files for creating a responsive webform. Make sure to save all of them in a single file system.
NOTE: For adding the css, I had kept the entire css folder from bootstrap 5 in my file system. In this repository, I have only uploaded the specific bootstrap file, so you may have to modify the path to the css file (in the HTML file) accordingly.
